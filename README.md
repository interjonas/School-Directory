# School-Directory
I designed this project as per assigned project specifications. The project was required to behave similarly to a simplified version of a school directory. There are three primary classes in this project; Person, Student, and Athlete. Athlete is a child class of student, which is the child class of Person. This program builds an instance of a specific class, whichever option the user chooses that class is created. The newly created class will be initiated by using inheritance to absorb overlapping common elements such as name and ID. After an instance is created we place it in a nested "container" and connect it using pointers. Then we connect the container pointers together to create a linked directory. While the overarching concept of linking these elements together does appear simple, the troubleshooting required especially in regards to segmentation faults is exhaustive. Once the data structure is properly built a number of companion functions must be designed such that the user can call the functions to access more information about the data structure. The program must support user calls to functions such as insertion, search, deletion, print, and print_all functions. Those functions allow the user view and manipulate the data set. The overall goal of this project was to properly implement custom dynamic based data structures which are properly connected with one another.
